# LeetCode Problem Solutions Repository

This repository contains my solutions to various LeetCode problems. I aim to maintain a daily streak of solving at least one LeetCode problem for a year.

## Directory Structure

The problems are organized into three directories:

- `easy`: Easy difficulty problems.
- `medium`: Medium difficulty problems.
- `hard`: Hard difficulty problems.

Feel free to navigate through the directories to explore the solutions.

## Code Comments Template

For each solution, I provide comments to explain the problem statement, the approach taken, and the complexity of the solution. <br>
#### Below is a template for the comments included at the beginning of each solution file:

```python
"""
<Problem Number>. <Problem Title>

Description:
<Description of the problem>

Approach:
<Overview of the solution approach>

Complexity:
Time complexity: O(<...>)
Space complexity: O(<...>)
"""
```

#### At the end of each file I also provide Solution examples with their expected outputs:

```python
# Example 1
s1 = "<Example Input 1>"

solution1 = Solution().<solution_method>(s1)
print(solution1)  # output: <Expected Output 1>
```
